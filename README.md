# 2048

2048 is a classic sliding tile puzzle game. The objective of the game is to combine tiles with the same number to create larger numbers, ultimately reaching the tile with the number 2048.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (or `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`) to slide the tiles in the desired direction.
2. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with their sum.
3. Continue sliding and merging tiles until you reach the 2048 tile or no more moves are possible.
